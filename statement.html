<h1>dismorfia</h1>
<p>The following project, Dismorfia, is a piece that opens and asks questions regarding one's physical appearance and our own perceptions of ourselves.

    It asks us to think if there's ever been a time in which our physical appearance is put down. Perhaps we're told or we feel as though we don't fit a certain criteria.<br><br>
    
    In a way, this piece is a personal letter from me to the viewers, and it is an expansion on my personal belief and outlook on life: there is beauty in everyone. But perhaps, and most importantly, this is a personal reflection for myself.<br><br> 
    
    Is dysmorphia created? Is it created by constant comments or stabs at our physical appearance? Is it a culmination of things including beauty standards, social media, and more?<br><br>
    
    Perhaps we never truly realize the power of our words until we hear something from someone else. To have a stranger come up to you or tell you through the user interface of a pink website that you look nice may seem insignificant, but it’s genuine. <br><br>
    
    This piece is a personal reminder that our own worst critics are ourselves, and maybe if we looked at ourselves from the perspective of others, we would see just how beautiful and precious we all are.
    
    The idea that there are flaws in one’s appearance is simply a lie for a flaw in a face can not be defined. Flaws are not a science, but a screwed, conceptual idea. Perceived flaws are based on illogical beauty standards, and by this logic (my logic), we don’t have flaws.
