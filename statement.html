<h1>dismorfia</h1>
<p>The following project, Dismorfia, is a piece that opens and asks questions regarding
    one's physical appearance and our own perceptions of ourselves. 
    <br><br>It asks us to think if there's ever
    been a time in which our physical appearance is put down. Perhaps we're told or we feel as though we don't fit a certain criteria. 
    <br><br> In a way, this piece is a personal letter from me to the viewers, and it is an expansion on
    my personal belief and outlook on life: there is beauty in everyone. 
    <br><br> This piece is a personal reminder that perhaps our own worst critics are ourselves, and maybe if we looked at ourselves 
    from the perspective of others, we would see just how beautiful and precious we all are.
